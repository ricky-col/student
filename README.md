#Student___Information___Management__System



The Student Information Management System is a console-based C program designed to efficiently manage student records for educational institutions. It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student details such as roll number, name, and marks. The system uses file handling to store data persistently in a binary file, enabling data to be saved and retrieved across multiple sessions. This project demonstrates core programming concepts including structures, file input/output, and menu-driven interaction without the need for a database.
